Topdressing smoothes out the surface of the athletic field, but more importantly it fills the aerification holes with amendments to keep these channels open for air and water to move into the root zone. Topdressing with calcined clay also keeps surfaces drier during rain events.",
    paragraphTwo: "The benefits of topdressing with a calcined clay are that it leaves channels in the filled aerification holes, permitting an excellent exchange of water and air at the root level. This promotes a deep, strong root structure, which is necessary to handle the day-to-day abuse of athletic turf. Due to the long degradation time for Turface®, it also prevents future compaction.",
